Take user input from the command line
If wrong input print “Incorrect input”.
Else if input ‘s’ and a txt file 
	Print the calibrate information from the txt file. 
Else if input ‘c’ and an image file
	Find the mid and diff hue from the middle 50 pixels
	Print this information to the terminal along with the file name and the saturation
    and value.
Else if input ‘d’, a txt file and an image file
	From the txt file retrieve the mid and diff hue, the saturation, the value, and the
    object name.
    Copy the image.
    For each object
        Create a binary matrix that identifies where the object if found by matching
        the pixel hue to equal mid hue ± diff hue, greater than value and the
        saturation.
        While there is still objects(ones) in the matrix find the object min coordinates, 
            and its height and width. This info is used to draw a box around the object on 
            the copied image.
            After an object is found remove it from the matrix and find the next object.
