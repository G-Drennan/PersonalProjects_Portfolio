Take a number from the command line. 
If no number in the commend line print a 
message and end program. This number is the amount 
of state machines that will be initialized.

For the number of state machines collect input 
    Ensure that the state machine is valid;
    -	There is a zero state machine id and that its 
        first state machine is 0 
    -	Each state machine id has non ambiguous transitions.
    -	The states are a number 0-19 and that the 
        transitions signals are 0-4.

If a state machine isnâ€™t valid print a relevant message and exit.

print what state machine ids have been initialized.

While there is input collect the input.   

    Ensure the state machine ID is one that was initialized initially.
    
    Depending on the type of command input display the relevant information.
    SM; displays what state its transitioning from to the state its 
        transitioning to. Then runs the relevant program of the next state.
    QM; has three types of queries
    a; shows the number of transitions, states and states ids 
        in ascending order of a states machine id.
    t; shows current valid transition signals of a states machine id.
    s; shows the current state of a state machine id.
